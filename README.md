# Cloud-Bursting_term-paper
Recent years have seen the emergence of cloud computing, a brand-new paradigm that promises to deliver services online. Cloud bursting is a method used in a hybrid cloud environment that mixes internal (or local) organisational resources with public cloud resources. It was once used to handle work overload on local resources, speed up the execution of distributed applications while maintaining the necessary degree of QoS, and make efficient use of personal resources. The key considerations when using cloud bursting are deciding how many and what kind of resources will be provisioned.
The type of workload to be burst to the public cloud and the timing of resource release are also important factors that should be considered. Researchers are keen on tackling these problems. The purpose of this study is to evaluate recent studies on cloud bursting and resource provisioning. We will explore how each study address the problem.
